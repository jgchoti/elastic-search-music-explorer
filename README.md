### 5. 🎵 Spotify Music Explorer

**Dataset**: [Spotify Tracks dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)

**Must-have**

- Index tracks with title, artist, album, genre, year, and audio features
- Search by song title or artist
- Filter by year, genre, or album

**Nice-to-have**

- Aggregations: average danceability/energy per genre, most common genres
- “Find similar songs” with `more_like_this`
- Vector search for music embeddings (e.g., based on audio features)

## ✅ Deliverables

1 repository and your code and queries should follow **clean coding practices**:

- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Organize queries in reusable functions
- Avoid hardcoding values unnecessarily

### 🌟 Nice-to-Have

If you finish early or want to explore advanced features:

- Implement **autocomplete** for search input
- Use the **“did you mean”** feature for misspelled queries
- Add **advanced aggregations** (e.g., histograms, percentiles)
- Visualize results in [Kibana](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kibana/index.htm) or a custom web UI
- Try **vector search** if your dataset supports embeddings for similarity queries
